This subdirectory contains the Homework 6 assignment for the IR tracker using the stepper motor that we checked out from the ECE parts room. To operate our code, simply do the following:
  1. Make sure the Adafruit_BBIO library is installed (this can be done via pip install)
  2. Run the python script
  3. Line up the IR emitter in the plane of the PTs
  4. Hit the start button to begin tracking (our button is on P9_12)
  5. Keep the IR emitter in the same plane and rotate around and watch the stepper motor keep locked on!
