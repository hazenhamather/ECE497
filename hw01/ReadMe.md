For the 7 items, I have completed the following:
1,3,4,5,6, and 7. The reason I do not have labels is because I 
am still working on getting my host computer setup for printing. The
etchasketch console game is working and in order to play, the following
things must be done.
1. Run the code
2. Input the size of the game
3. Tell the game where to start
4. use the words "up", "down", "left", or "right" to move around
5. enter "clear" or "shake" to start over.
