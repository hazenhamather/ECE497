Contained in this directory is the homework 7 assignment where we compared response times of different languages
and methods. My language of choice was Python while the other languages required were mmap via c, kernel, and PRU.

A report file is contained in this directory and it was written with LibreOffice Writer so if it proves difficult
to open, I can try to move it over to a Word document.
