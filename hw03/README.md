The EtchaSketch game on the LED Matrix is simple to play. Simply hit run
and the code takes care of the rest. The game is an 8x8 grid and it defaults
to the color green. If I had more time to work on this, I might consider
changing the current position color if the user passes over a tile that has
already been crossed. 

The temperature sensors were quite tough to implement and I was only able
to configure them and get a temperature reading. If the shell file is run,
the output to the console is the temperature from each thermostat in F.
