The EtchaSketch game on the LED Matrix is simple to play. Simply hit run
and the code takes care of the rest. The game is an 8x8 grid and it defaults
to the color green. One of the cool features of this game is both the manual
reset as well as the self reset capability. A fifth button was wired to act
as the manual reset button and the program was also designed to self reset
after all of the tiles had been filled up, allowing the user to play as long
as desired. If I had more time to work on this, I might consider
changing the current position color if the user passes over a tile that has
already been crossed. 

The temperature sensors were quite tough to implement and I was only able
to configure them and get a temperature reading. If the shell file is run,
the output to the console is the temperature from each thermostat in F.
